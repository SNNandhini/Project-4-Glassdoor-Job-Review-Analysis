## Proposal 

Glassdoor is one the fastest growing jobs and recruiting sites. Glassdoor holds a growing database of millions of company reviews, CEO approval ratings, salary reports, interview reviews and questions, benefits reviews, office photos and more. We will take a deeper look in some of the job reviews to see if we can identify any trends and interpret the reviews. Our aim is to build a machine learning model using !!!!Natural Language Processing!!! to predict how helpful the Glassdoor reviews are.
